# MASTER PROMPT: CRC Prediction Feature Selection Methodology Improvement

## Project Overview

This project is improving the **feature selection methodology** for a **colorectal cancer (CRC) risk prediction model** with highly imbalanced data (250:1 negative:positive ratio). The model predicts CRC diagnosis within 6 months for unscreened patients.

**Current Status**: All notebooks complete. Ready to run pipeline in Databricks.

## Completed Work Summary

### Phase 1: Book 0 - Cohort Creation with SGKF Splits (COMPLETE)

Added train/val/test split assignments using **patient-level** temporal + stratified splitting:
- **TEST**: Patients with ANY Q6 observation → ALL their observations go to TEST (patient-level temporal holdout)
- **TRAIN (~67%)**: Remaining patients (no Q6 observations) via SGKF
- **VAL (~33%)**: Remaining patients (no Q6 observations) via SGKF

**Stratification classes:**
- 0 = Negative (no CRC diagnosis)
- 1 = C18 (colon cancer)
- 2 = C19 (rectosigmoid junction cancer)
- 3 = C20 (rectal cancer)

Key guarantees:
- NO patient appears in multiple splits (grouped by PAT_ID)
- **Cancer type distribution (C18/C19/C20) preserved** across splits
- Rare subtypes (especially C19 rectosigmoid) proportionally represented
- Random seed 217 for reproducibility

**Why patient-level temporal split?** Patients often span multiple quarters (visits in Q3, Q4, Q5, AND Q6). If we split by observation quarter, a patient's Q0-Q5 history would be in TRAIN while their Q6 outcome is in TEST—causing data leakage. By assigning ALL observations from Q6 patients to TEST, we simulate true deployment where the model predicts on patients it has never seen.

Bugs fixed:
- Changed `F.first("FUTURE_CRC_EVENT")` to `F.max("FUTURE_CRC_EVENT")` for correct patient-level stratification
- Changed observation-level temporal split to patient-level (fixed 72K+ patient train/test overlap)

### Phase 2: Books 1-8 - Train-Only Feature Selection (COMPLETE)

All feature engineering notebooks now filter on `SPLIT='train'` for feature selection metrics:

| Book | Status | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| Book 1 (Vitals) | COMPLETE | df_train for risk ratios & MI |
| Book 2 (ICD10) | COMPLETE | df_train for risk ratios & MI |
| Book 3 (Social) | NO CHANGES | All features excluded due to data quality |
| Book 4 (Labs) | COMPLETE | df_train for risk ratios & MI |
| Book 5.1 (Outpatient Meds) | COMPLETE | df_train for risk ratios & MI |
| Book 5.2 (Inpatient Meds) | COMPLETE | df_train for risk ratios & MI |
| Book 6 (Visit History) | COMPLETE | df_train for risk ratios & MI |
| Book 7 (Procedures) | COMPLETE | df_train for risk ratios & MI |
| Book 8 (Compilation) | NO CHANGES | Just joins reduced tables |

### Phase 3: Original Methodology Analysis (COMPLETE)

Analyzed two notebooks in Original_Methodology folder:

**1. CORRELATION_HIERARCHICAL_FEATURE_CLUSTERING.py** (465 lines)
- Spearman correlation with distance = 1 - |correlation|
- Average linkage hierarchical clustering
- Fixed threshold 0.7 (correlation > 0.3)
- Outputs cluster assignments to CSV

**2. CRC_ITER1_MODEL-PREVALENCE.py** (1873 lines)
- SHAP calculation separate for positive/negative cases
- Combined importance: `(importance_pos * 2 + importance_neg) / 3`
- Removal criteria: near-zero (<0.0002), neg-biased ratio (<0.15), bottom 8%
- Features must meet 2+ criteria for removal
- Iterative removal with cluster preservation rules

### Issues Identified in Original Methodology

| Issue | Problem | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **SHAP Weighting** | 2:1 positive weight for 250:1 imbalance | Negatives dominate ~99% of combined importance |
| **Fixed Threshold** | 0.7 hardcoded for all features | May be suboptimal; no data-driven justification |
| **No Train-Only Split** | Clustering on full dataset | Potential data leakage (now fixed in Books 1-8) |

## Phase 4: New Feature Selection Pipeline (COMPLETE)

### Pipeline Overview

Create `V2_Book9_Feature_Selection.py` using a **Hybrid Two-Phase Approach**:

| Phase | Method | Features | Purpose |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Phase 1** | Cluster-Based Reduction | 171 → ~70-80 | Remove redundant/correlated features |
| **Phase 2** | Iterative SHAP Winnowing | ~70-80 → Final | Fine-tune with 20-25 removals per iteration |

### Input
- Wide feature table from Book 8 compilation (~171 features)
- Train/val/test split assignments from Book 0

### Output
- Final reduced feature set (determined by validation gate, not arbitrary target)
- Cluster assignments with justification
- SHAP importance rankings per iteration
- Iteration tracking CSV with overfitting metrics

---

### PHASE 1: Cluster-Based Reduction (171 → ~70-80 features)

**Goal**: Remove redundant features by keeping one representative per cluster.

**Rationale**: Correlated features provide redundant information. Keeping the best representative per cluster removes redundancy without losing predictive signal.

```
Step 1.1: Load Data
├── Load wide feature table from Book 8
├── Filter to SPLIT='train' only for correlation computation
└── Verify ~171 features loaded

Step 1.2: Compute Correlation Matrix
├── Spearman correlation (handles non-linear relationships)
├── Distance matrix: distance = 1 - |correlation|
└── Compute on TRAINING DATA ONLY

Step 1.3: Dynamic Threshold Selection
├── Test thresholds: 0.50, 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90
├── For each threshold:
│   ├── Run hierarchical clustering (average linkage)
│   ├── Count resulting clusters
│   └── Compute silhouette score (cluster quality)
├── Select threshold that balances:
│   ├── Reasonable cluster count (not too few, not all singletons)
│   └── Good silhouette score
├── Document chosen threshold with rationale
└── CHECKPOINT: Save clusters.pkl (correlation matrix, linkage, assignments)

Step 1.4: Train Baseline Model (All Features)
├── XGBoost with conservative hyperparameters
├── Early stopping on validation set
├── Record: baseline_auprc_train, baseline_auprc_val, baseline_auprc_test
├── Record: baseline_train_val_gap (overfitting indicator)
└── CHECKPOINT: Save baseline_model.pkl

Step 1.5: Compute SHAP with 2:1 Positive Weighting
├── TreeExplainer on baseline model
├── Compute SHAP separately for positive and negative cases
├── 2:1 weighting (model already uses scale_pos_weight for imbalance):
│   importance_combined = (importance_pos * 2 + importance_neg) / 3
├── Compute importance_ratio = importance_pos / importance_neg
└── This ratio identifies features most predictive of POSITIVE cases
├── CHECKPOINT: Save shap_phase1.pkl

Step 1.6: Select Cluster Representatives
├── For each cluster:
│   ├── Rank features by importance_ratio (descending)
│   ├── Cluster size 1-7: Keep top 1 feature
│   └── Cluster size 8+: Keep top 2 features
├── Singletons: Keep if importance_ratio > median, else flag for Phase 2
└── Output: ~70-80 features (depends on cluster count)

Step 1.7: Phase 1 Validation Gate
├── Train model with reduced feature set
├── Compare to baseline:
│   ├── val_auprc_drop = (baseline_val - reduced_val) / baseline_val
│   └── train_val_gap_change = reduced_gap - baseline_gap
├── PASS if: val_auprc_drop < 10% AND gap didn't increase significantly
├── If FAIL: Adjust (keep top 2 per cluster, or raise threshold)
└── CHECKPOINT: Save phase1_complete.pkl (feature list, model, metrics)
```

---

### PHASE 2: Iterative SHAP Winnowing (~70-80 → Final)

**Goal**: Carefully remove low-value features 20-25 at a time until validation performance degrades.

**Rationale**: After redundancy removal, remaining features may still include low-value ones. Iterative removal with validation gates prevents over-reduction.

```
For each iteration (starting from Phase 1 output):

Step 2.1: Train Model on Current Feature Set
├── XGBoost with same hyperparameters
├── Early stopping on validation set
├── Record: iter_auprc_train, iter_auprc_val, iter_auprc_test, iter_gap
└── CHECKPOINT: Save iter{N}_model.pkl

Step 2.2: Compute SHAP with 2:1 Positive Weighting
├── Same method as Phase 1
├── Rank all features by importance_combined
└── CHECKPOINT: Save iter{N}_shap.pkl

Step 2.3: Identify Removal Candidates (max 20-25)
├── Criteria for removal (must meet 2+ of 3):
│   ├── Near-zero importance: < 0.0002
│   ├── Negative-biased ratio: importance_ratio < 0.2
│   └── Bottom percentile: bottom 15% by importance_combined
├── Cap removals at 20-25 per iteration
└── Never remove features in top 50% by importance_ratio

Step 2.4: Iteration Validation Gate
├── Compute metrics:
│   ├── val_auprc_drop = (baseline_val - iter_val) / baseline_val
│   ├── gap_increase = iter_gap - baseline_gap
│   └── test_auprc_drop (monitor only, don't optimize on it)
├── STOP CONDITIONS (any triggers stop):
│   ├── val_auprc_drop > 5% from BASELINE (not previous iteration)
│   ├── gap_increase > 0.02 (overfitting getting worse)
│   ├── Feature count < 30 (minimum threshold)
│   └── No features meet removal criteria
└── If STOP: Revert to previous iteration's feature set

Step 2.5: Log & Checkpoint
├── Append to iteration_tracking.csv
├── CHECKPOINT: Save iter{N}_complete.pkl (feature list, metrics, removal list)
└── Continue to next iteration OR stop if gate triggered
```

---

### Overfitting Detection Strategy

| Metric | Formula | Threshold | Action |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Val AUPRC Drop** | (baseline - current) / baseline | > 5% | STOP |
| **Train-Val Gap** | train_auprc - val_auprc | Increasing > 0.02 | STOP |
| **Test Monitoring** | Track but don't optimize | N/A | Report only |

**Key Principle**: We optimize on validation, monitor test, and never touch test for decisions. Final test evaluation happens once at the very end.

---

### Checkpoint System (Resumable Iterations)

**Goal**: Stop anytime and resume without starting over.

```
checkpoints/
├── step1_2_correlation.pkl      # After correlation matrix computed
├── step1_3_clusters.pkl         # After clustering complete
├── step1_4_baseline_model.pkl   # After baseline model trained
├── step1_5_shap_phase1.pkl      # After Phase 1 SHAP computed
├── step1_7_phase1_complete.pkl  # After Phase 1 validation gate
├── step2_iter1_model.pkl        # After iteration 1 model
├── step2_iter1_shap.pkl         # After iteration 1 SHAP
├── step2_iter1_complete.pkl     # After iteration 1 complete
├── step2_iter2_model.pkl        # ...and so on
└── iteration_tracking.csv       # Running log (always updated)
```

**On notebook startup:**
1. Scan for existing checkpoints
2. Display: "Found checkpoint at Phase 2, Iteration 3. Resume? [Y/n]"
3. If resume: Load checkpoint and continue
4. If fresh: Clear checkpoints directory and start over

**You can kill the notebook anytime** - just re-run and it picks up from the last checkpoint.

### Key Improvements Over Original

| Aspect | Original | New |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **SHAP Weighting** | 2:1 | 2:1 (same; model handles imbalance via scale_pos_weight) |
| **Clustering Threshold** | Fixed 0.7 | Dynamic via silhouette score |
| **Removal Cap** | 30 per iteration | 20-25 per iteration (more conservative) |
| **Stop Criterion** | Manual | Automatic validation gate |
| **Overfitting Detection** | Train-val gap tracking | Gap + absolute drop thresholds |
| **Two-Phase Approach** | Single iterative loop | Cluster reduction THEN iterative winnowing |
| **Resumability** | None (start over) | Granular checkpoints after each step |

---

### Expected Outcome

```
Starting:     171 features
After Phase 1: ~70-80 features (cluster representatives)
After Phase 2: ~40-60 features (validation-gated)

Iterations breakdown:
  Phase 2, Iter 1: 75 → 55 features (-20)
  Phase 2, Iter 2: 55 → 35 features (-20)
  Phase 2, Iter 3: STOP (val_auprc_drop > 5%)
  Final: Revert to 55 features
```

The actual stopping point depends on the data - we let the validation gate decide.

## Important Technical Context

- **Platform**: Databricks with PySpark
- **Data**: Can't query directly (siloed environment) - work from code
- **Table**: `{trgt_cat}.clncl_ds.herald_eda_train_final_cohort`
- **Class Imbalance**: 250:1 (0.41% positive rate)
- **Prediction Window**: 6 months
- **Cohort Period**: Jan 2023 - Sept 2024
- **Random Seed**: 217 (for all random operations)

## User Preferences

- Linear, readable code (no nested functions for now)
- Discuss changes before implementing
- Keep all logic in single notebooks (no separate utility files)
- Add progress print statements for long-running operations
- Preserve all original functionality unless explicitly changing
- Add "What This Cell Does" / "Conclusion" markdown cells

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Patient-Level Temporal Split**: Q6 patients (all their observations) as TEST + SGKF for remaining patients into train/val with multi-class stratification by cancer type (C18/C19/C20)
2. **3-Fold CV**: For computational efficiency with ~171 features
3. **Linear Code Style**: No nested functions - keep readable for debugging
4. **Documentation**: "What This Cell Does" + "Conclusion" markdown cells
5. **Dynamic Clustering Threshold**: Silhouette-based instead of fixed 0.7
6. **SHAP Weighting**: 2:1 for positive cases (model handles imbalance via scale_pos_weight)
7. **End Goal**: predict_proba -> isotonic calibration -> 0-100 risk score
8. **Resumable Pipeline**: Granular checkpoints allow stopping/resuming at any step

## Statistical Methods Rationale (SOP II.3.b Deviation)

The SOP specifies ChiSquared (for categorical features) and ANOVA (for numerical features) as statistical methods for feature selection. This pipeline uses **Risk Ratios** and **Mutual Information** instead. This is a deliberate methodological choice, not an oversight.

**Why p-value-based tests are inappropriate at this scale:** With N=831,000 observations, traditional hypothesis tests (ChiSquared, ANOVA) become meaningless. At this sample size, even trivially small effects achieve statistical significance (p < 0.001). A feature with Risk Ratio of 1.01—clinically irrelevant—would pass a ChiSquared test with flying colors simply because the massive sample size crushes sampling noise. The p-value answers "is this association unlikely due to chance?" but at N=831K, the answer is always "yes" for any non-zero effect, regardless of whether that effect matters clinically.

**Why Risk Ratios and Mutual Information are superior for this use case:** Risk Ratios directly quantify *effect size*—a 3.6× risk elevation for rapid weight loss is clinically interpretable and actionable, while "p < 0.001" conveys no magnitude. Mutual Information captures the *information content* of features, including non-linear relationships that correlation-based tests miss. Both metrics scale appropriately with clinical relevance rather than sample size. The SOP lists Mutual Information as an acceptable method (II.3.b.i), and Risk Ratios are the standard effect size measure in epidemiology for categorical outcomes.

**Bottom line:** ChiSquared and ANOVA would produce compliance checkboxes, not better feature selection. The current methodology identifies features that matter clinically, not just features that achieve arbitrary significance thresholds.

## Running the Pipeline

1. **Upload notebooks to Databricks** (Books 0-9 in order)
2. **Run Books 0-8** to create the wide feature table with SPLIT column
3. **Run Book 9** for feature selection:
   - Phase 1: Cluster-based reduction (~171 → ~70-80 features)
   - Phase 2: Iterative SHAP winnowing (~70-80 → final)
   - Checkpoints saved after each step (kill anytime, resume on re-run)
4. **Outputs** in `feature_selection_outputs/`:
   - `final_features.txt` - Feature list
   - `final_features.py` - Importable Python list
   - `final_model.pkl` - Trained model
   - `iteration_tracking.csv` - Metrics per iteration

---

## Reference: Pattern Applied to Books 1-8

```python
# 1. Add SPLIT to the cohort join
df_cohort = spark.sql("""
    SELECT PAT_ID, END_DTTM, FUTURE_CRC_EVENT, SPLIT
    FROM dev.clncl_ds.herald_eda_train_final_cohort
""")

# 2. Create training-only dataframe for feature selection
df_train = df_spark.filter(F.col("SPLIT") == "train")
df_train.cache()

# 3. Use df_train for all feature selection metrics
baseline_crc_rate = df_train.select(F.avg('FUTURE_CRC_EVENT')).collect()[0][0]
# Risk ratios calculated on df_train
# MI scores calculated on df_train sample
```

## Reference: SGKF Implementation (Book 0)

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedGroupKFold

# Create multi-class stratification label: 0=negative, 1=C18, 2=C19, 3=C20
cancer_type_map = {'C18': 1, 'C19': 2, 'C20': 3}
patient_labels['strat_label'] = patient_labels.apply(
    lambda row: cancer_type_map.get(row['cancer_type'], 0) if row['is_positive'] == 1 else 0,
    axis=1
)

sgkf = StratifiedGroupKFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=217)
y = patient_labels['strat_label'].values  # Multi-class: 0=neg, 1=C18, 2=C19, 3=C20
groups = patient_labels['PAT_ID'].values
# Takes first fold split: ~67% train, ~33% val
train_idx, val_idx = next(sgkf.split(X_dummy, y, groups))
```
