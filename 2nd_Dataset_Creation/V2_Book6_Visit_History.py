# MAGIC ## 🎯 Quick Start: What This Notebook Does
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **In 3 sentences:**
# MAGIC 1. This notebook extracts 41 healthcare utilization and procedure history features from **831,397 patient-month observations** for colorectal cancer (CRC) risk prediction.
# MAGIC 2. We analyze these features to identify patterns signaling undiagnosed pathology in a screening-overdue population, finding that primary care engagement is a strong indicator (Risk Ratio 2.55 for engaged primary care).
# MAGIC 3. We then reduce the initial set of 41 features to **23 key features** (a 43.9% reduction) while preserving all critical signals for efficient model training.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Key finding:** A significant care gap exists, with 8.2% of patients having GI-related symptoms across all settings, but only 0.9% seeing a GI specialist in the past 12 months.
# MAGIC **Output:** `herald_eda_train_visit_features_reduced` table with 831,397 rows.

# MAGIC # Herald Visit History and Procedure Features Notebook
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Introduction and Objectives
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook extracts healthcare utilization patterns and procedure history from 11,443,201 patient-month observations for CRC risk prediction. Visit patterns reveal both clinical symptoms and care-seeking behaviors, while procedure history identifies relevant interventions and diagnostic workups. This cohort has been specifically selected to exclude patients with recent screening, allowing us to focus on the overdue population where utilization patterns may signal undiagnosed pathology.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Clinical Motivation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Why Visit History Matters for CRC Risk
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Healthcare utilization patterns provide critical context for risk assessment:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Symptom-Driven Encounters**
# MAGIC    - ED visits for GI symptoms indicate acute presentations
# MAGIC    - Hospitalization patterns reveal severity
# MAGIC    - GI specialist visits suggest recognized pathology
# MAGIC    - Primary care continuity affects screening adherence
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Diagnostic Cascades**
# MAGIC    - Abnormal labs trigger further testing
# MAGIC    - Anemia workups lead to GI evaluation
# MAGIC    - Emergency presentations prompt investigations
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Care Gaps**
# MAGIC    - Symptoms without specialty follow-up
# MAGIC    - Abnormal results without investigation
# MAGIC    - ED visits without GI referral
# MAGIC    - These gaps modify other risk factors
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Cohort Context
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Critical Design Feature
# MAGIC This cohort **excludes patients with recent screening** (colonoscopy, FIT, etc.), meaning:
# MAGIC - Zero colonoscopy/polypectomy procedures expected in lookback period
# MAGIC - Population is overdue for screening by definition
# MAGIC - Any GI symptoms or abnormal labs are particularly concerning
# MAGIC - Healthcare utilization despite no screening suggests barriers
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Expected Patterns
# MAGIC Given the screening-overdue population:
# MAGIC - **Higher symptom burden**: Potential undiagnosed pathology
# MAGIC - **More ED utilization**: Crisis management instead of prevention
# MAGIC - **Lower specialty care**: Access barriers preventing screening
# MAGIC - **Primary care gaps**: Missing preventive care opportunities
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Feature Engineering Strategy
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Visit Pattern Features
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Healthcare Settings (12-24 month windows)**
# MAGIC    - ED visit count and recency
# MAGIC    - Hospitalization count and length of stay
# MAGIC    - GI specialist encounters
# MAGIC    - Primary care visit frequency
# MAGIC    - Any setting with GI symptoms
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Specialty Engagement**
# MAGIC    - Gastroenterology visits
# MAGIC    - Primary care continuity metrics
# MAGIC    - No-show patterns
# MAGIC    - Care fragmentation indicators
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Care Continuity Metrics**
# MAGIC    - Primary care provider consistency
# MAGIC    - Days since last primary care
# MAGIC    - Preventive care engagement
# MAGIC    - Missed appointment patterns
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Composite Risk Scores
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Combines multiple domains:
# MAGIC - Healthcare utilization intensity
# MAGIC - Symptom-related encounters
# MAGIC - Care continuity patterns
# MAGIC - Acute vs routine care balance
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Expected Outcomes
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Utilization Patterns
# MAGIC Based on screening-age population characteristics:
# MAGIC - **ED visits**: 10-15% (higher than general population)
# MAGIC - **Hospitalizations**: 1-3% (moderate acuity)
# MAGIC - **GI specialists**: 0.5-1% (care gap expected)
# MAGIC - **Primary care**: 40-60% (suboptimal for screening age)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Risk Score Distribution
# MAGIC - **Score 0**: ~70% (minimal utilization)
# MAGIC - **Score 1-2**: ~25% (moderate concern)
# MAGIC - **Score 3+**: ~5% (high complexity)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Clinical Significance
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Visit patterns reveal critical insights:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Diagnostic Delays**
# MAGIC    - Symptoms present but screening delayed
# MAGIC    - Abnormal patterns without follow-through
# MAGIC    - ED management instead of prevention
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Care Fragmentation**
# MAGIC    - Multiple settings without coordination
# MAGIC    - Specialty access barriers
# MAGIC    - Missing preventive care
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **System Failures**
# MAGIC    - High-risk patients not receiving screening
# MAGIC    - Symptoms managed without definitive diagnosis
# MAGIC    - Reactive instead of preventive care
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Technical Implementation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Data Sources
# MAGIC - **Encounter tables**: Visit details and diagnoses
# MAGIC - **Department mapping**: Specialty identification
# MAGIC - **Appointment tables**: Including no-show tracking
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Processing Approach
# MAGIC 1. **Temporal aggregation**: 12 and 24-month windows
# MAGIC 2. **Setting classification**: ED vs inpatient vs outpatient
# MAGIC 3. **Symptom detection**: ICD codes for GI symptoms
# MAGIC 4. **Score calculation**: Weighted combination of factors
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Quality Controls
# MAGIC - Validate expected patterns against cohort design
# MAGIC - Check for reasonable maximum values
# MAGIC - Identify outliers for review
# MAGIC - Ensure temporal consistency
# MAGIC

# MAGIC ### CELL 1 - Create ED/Inpatient Encounters with GI Symptom Flags
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell creates a temporary table, `herald_eda_train_ed_inp_encounters`, by extracting all Emergency Department (ED) and Inpatient encounters from the `clarity_cur.pat_enc_hsp_har_enh` table. It also flags encounters associated with common GI symptoms (GI bleeding, bowel changes, abdominal pain, anemia) using ICD codes. A critical data quality cutoff of '2021-07-01' is applied to ensure data reliability.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Visit History
# MAGIC ED and Inpatient visits are crucial indicators of acute health issues and disease severity. Identifying GI-related symptoms within these encounters helps pinpoint patients who may be experiencing undiagnosed pathology relevant to CRC risk, especially in a screening-overdue cohort. The length of stay (LOS) also provides insight into the severity of the inpatient episodes.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - **`earliest_visit`**: Should be on or after the '2021-07-01' cutoff.
# MAGIC - **`total_encounters`**: Expect a large number of encounters, reflecting comprehensive data extraction.
# MAGIC - **`pre_cutoff_count`**: Must be 0, confirming the data quality filter is correctly applied.

# MAGIC ### CELL 2 - Create Outpatient Encounters (Including All Appointment Statuses)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell generates the `herald_eda_train_op_encounters` table, compiling all outpatient encounters from `clarity_cur.pat_enc_enh`. It identifies GI specialty visits, flags primary care provider (PCP) visits, and detects GI symptoms based on ICD-10 codes. Importantly, it includes all appointment statuses (completed, arrived, no-show, etc.) to allow for comprehensive no-show tracking.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Visit History
# MAGIC Outpatient visits represent the bulk of routine healthcare engagement. Tracking these visits, especially those with GI specialists or PCPs, provides insights into preventive care, specialty access, and care continuity. Including all appointment statuses is critical for understanding patient adherence and potential barriers to care, such as missed appointments.
# MAGIC

# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell calculates various ED and Inpatient utilization metrics for each patient-month observation in the `herald_eda_train_final_cohort`. It aggregates counts of ED visits, GI symptom-related ED visits, Inpatient visits, GI symptom-related Inpatient visits, and total Inpatient days over 3, 12, and 24-month lookback windows.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Visit History
# MAGIC These aggregated metrics provide a concise summary of a patient's acute care utilization. Frequent ED visits or hospitalizations, especially those with GI symptoms, are strong indicators of underlying health issues and potential diagnostic delays. Different lookback windows capture both recent acute events and longer-term patterns of care.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - The output confirms the creation of the `herald_eda_train_ed_inp_metrics` table.
# MAGIC - This step is purely aggregation, so the primary validation will occur when these metrics are joined and analyzed in later cells.

# MAGIC ### CELL 6 - Add Recency Features Using Window Functions
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell calculates recency features, specifically the number of days since the last ED visit, inpatient admission, and GI specialty visit, within a 24-month lookback window. It achieves this by combining relevant encounters, calculating `days_since` the `END_DTTM`, and then using window functions to find the most recent visit for each type. The results are stored in `herald_eda_train_visit_recency`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Visit History
# MAGIC Recency features are crucial for understanding the temporal aspect of healthcare utilization. A recent ED visit or hospitalization indicates an acute or ongoing health issue, while a recent GI specialist visit suggests active investigation. These features provide a sense of urgency and current clinical status that simple visit counts might miss.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - The output confirms the creation of the `herald_eda_train_visit_recency` table.
# MAGIC - Null values are expected for patients who have not had a specific type of visit within the lookback period, which is informative.

# MAGIC This cell combines the `herald_eda_train_visit_counts` and `herald_eda_train_visit_recency` tables. It then engineers several composite features, including flags for frequent ED users, frequent inpatient admissions, high inpatient days, engaged primary care, GI specialty engagement, recent ED use, and recent hospitalization.

# MAGIC This cell conducts a zero-inflation analysis, calculating the percentage of zero values for each visit history feature. It identifies features where a high proportion of patients have a count of zero, which is common and expected for utilization data, especially for rare events like specialist visits or frequent acute care.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Visit History
# MAGIC Zero inflation is a critical characteristic of healthcare utilization data. A high percentage of zeros for a feature (e.g., GI specialist visits) can indicate access barriers, lack of symptoms, or a population that is generally disengaged from that specific type of care. Understanding this helps in interpreting feature distributions and informs modeling strategies.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - **Features with >90% zeros**: These are typically rare events (e.g., GI inpatient visits, frequent inpatient flags) where the absence of an event is the norm.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC The zero-inflation analysis confirmed expected patterns in healthcare utilization features:
# MAGIC - Many features, particularly those related to acute GI events or frequent admissions, showed high zero-inflation (e.g., `GI_INP_LAST_12_MONTHS` at **99.6% zeros**, `GI_VISITS_12MO` at **99.1% zeros**). This indicates that these are rare events within the cohort.
# MAGIC - More common events, such as `OUTPATIENT_VISITS_12MO` (**19.8% zeros**) and `OUTPATIENT_VISITS_24MO` (**5.0% zeros**), had much lower zero-inflation, as expected.
# MAGIC - Recency features, while not directly showing zero-inflation, have high missing rates (as seen in Cell 14), which serves a similar purpose in indicating the absence of an event.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Key Achievement**: Validated the expected zero-inflation patterns in the visit history features, confirming that rare events are appropriately represented.

# MAGIC This cell delves into specific utilization patterns, identifying "high healthcare utilizers" based on a healthcare intensity score. It also examines patients with active GI workups (those with both GI specialist visits and GI symptoms) and analyzes the characteristics of patients with no primary care provider (PCP) visits, comparing their ED utilization to those with PCP engagement.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Visit History
# MAGIC This analysis helps to identify distinct patient subgroups with different healthcare engagement profiles. Understanding high utilizers, patients actively undergoing GI workups, and those lacking primary care is crucial for targeting interventions and understanding systemic care gaps that could impact CRC screening and diagnosis.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - **High healthcare utilizers**: The number and percentage of patients with a high intensity score, along with their average visit counts across settings.
# MAGIC - **Active GI workup**: The number of patients who are actively seeing a GI specialist and have GI symptoms, indicating ongoing investigation.
# MAGIC - **No PCP visits**: The number of patients without PCP engagement and a comparison of their ED utilization to those with PCP visits, which can highlight reliance on emergency care.

# MAGIC #### 📊 Cell 12 Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The utilization pattern analysis revealed important insights into patient engagement and care gaps:
# MAGIC - **8,234 patients (1.0%)** were identified as high healthcare utilizers (intensity score ≥2), demonstrating significantly higher mean ED visits (3.3), hospitalizations (2.9), and outpatient visits (32.5) compared to the overall cohort.
# MAGIC - **3,025 patients (0.4%)** were actively undergoing a GI workup (had both GI specialist visits and GI symptoms).
# MAGIC - A substantial **520,805 patients (62.6%)** had no PCP visits in the last 12 months. Interestingly, these patients had a mean of **0.33** ED visits, which is comparable to the **0.40** mean ED visits for patients with PCP engagement, suggesting that ED care may be substituting for primary care.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Key Achievement**: Identified specific patient utilization patterns, including high utilizers and a significant population lacking primary care, highlighting potential areas for intervention.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell performs final data quality checks, focusing on identifying extreme outliers in key utilization features and verifying logical consistency across related features. It checks for values that are significantly higher than the 99.9th percentile and looks for inconsistencies such as inpatient visits with zero days of stay or GI visits exceeding total outpatient visits.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Visit History
# MAGIC Robust data quality is paramount for reliable model training and clinical decision-making. Identifying extreme outliers helps to understand the range of patient behavior and decide whether these represent valid, complex cases or potential data entry errors. Logical consistency checks ensure that related features make sense together, preventing erroneous data from impacting the model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - **Extreme values check**: Note any features with maximum values significantly higher than their 99.9th percentile, and the number of such extreme cases.
# MAGIC - **Logical consistency checks**: Ensure that percentages and counts align logically (e.g., ED visits > 0 but GI ED = 0 should be a reasonable percentage, not 100%).

# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell calculates the percentage of missing values for each feature in the `herald_eda_train_visit_features_final` table. It converts the Spark DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame for easier null value calculation and then displays the proportion of nulls for each column.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Visit History
# MAGIC Understanding missing data patterns is crucial for data quality and model preparation. For features like `days_since_last_ed`, a high percentage of nulls is expected and informative, indicating that a patient has not had that type of visit within the lookback period. For other features, unexpected nulls might signal data issues.

# MAGIC 4. **gi_specialty_engagement_flag** - Care quality marker (RR=5.62)
# MAGIC 5. **healthcare_intensity_score** - Overall complexity
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Tier 2 Features (Moderate Signal)
# MAGIC 1. **ED_LAST_90_DAYS** - Recent acute issues
# MAGIC 2. **recent_hospitalization_flag** - Severity marker (RR=3.56)
# MAGIC 3. **primary_care_continuity_ratio** - Care coordination
# MAGIC 4. **days_since_last_gi** - Temporal patterns for GI care
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Tier 3 Features (Context)
# MAGIC 1. **NO_SHOWS_12MO** - Access barriers
# MAGIC 2. **OUTPATIENT_VISITS_24MO** - Long-term engagement
# MAGIC 3. **frequent_ed_user_flag** - Crisis pattern indicator (RR=2.01)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Clinical Implications
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Population Characteristics
# MAGIC This cohort represents a medically underserved population:
# MAGIC - **Nearly 20% completely disengaged** from outpatient care.
# MAGIC - **Minimal specialty access** despite clear need.
# MAGIC - **Emergency-focused** utilization patterns.
# MAGIC - **Poor care continuity** when engaged.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### System Failures Identified
# MAGIC 1. **Primary care gap**: 62.6% without PCP visits.
# MAGIC 2. **Specialty bottleneck**: 0.9% GI access vs 8.2% need.
# MAGIC 3. **Fragmented care**: 0.26 continuity ratio.
# MAGIC 4. **Reactive model**: ED substituting for prevention.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Conclusion
# MAGIC The visit history features reveal a population with significant unmet healthcare needs. Despite 8.2% having GI-related symptoms, only 0.9% access GI specialists, and 62.6% lack primary care engagement. The healthcare utilization patterns show fragmented, crisis-driven care with poor continuity and significant access barriers. This is not a "worried well" population but rather an underserved group with objective symptoms receiving inadequate evaluation. The model must account for these systemic barriers while identifying the highest-risk patients for immediate intervention.

# MAGIC ### Introduction: Visit History Feature Reduction
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Reducing visit history features from 41 to a more manageable set of ~20-25 most predictive features is crucial for efficient model training and interpretability. This process preserves the essential healthcare utilization patterns critical for CRC risk assessment within our 831,397 patient-month observations. The initial feature set is comprehensive, covering ED, inpatient, outpatient, GI-specific, and composite measures.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Methodology
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our feature reduction approach balances statistical metrics with clinical knowledge:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1.  **Calculate Feature Importance Metrics**: We assess risk ratios for binary features, correlation analysis for count features, and Mutual Information for capturing non-linear relationships. Missing data patterns for recency features are also considered.
# MAGIC 2.  **Apply Domain Knowledge Filters**: We preserve high-risk features (e.g., GI symptoms, ED utilization) and remove features with near-zero variance or high redundancy.
# MAGIC 3.  **Create Clinical Composites**: We engineer new features that represent care gaps (symptoms without specialty follow-up), crisis care patterns (frequent ED without PCP), acute care reliance, and complexity categories for risk stratification.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Expected Outcomes
# MAGIC
# MAGIC From an initial set of 41 features, we aim to reduce to approximately 25 key features that:
# MAGIC -   Accurately capture GI symptom burden across all settings.
# MAGIC -   Preserve critical ED and hospitalization patterns.
# MAGIC -   Include robust care continuity and engagement metrics.
# MAGIC -   Effectively identify system failures and care gaps.
# MAGIC -   Enable efficient model training while maintaining strong interpretability.

# MAGIC ### STEP 1 - Load Data and Add Prefix
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell loads the `herald_eda_train_visit_features_final` table and joins it with the `herald_eda_train_final_cohort` to include the `FUTURE_CRC_EVENT` outcome variable. It then adds a `visit_` prefix to all feature columns (excluding `PAT_ID`, `END_DTTM`, and `FUTURE_CRC_EVENT`) to prevent namespace collisions in combined models. Finally, it caches the resulting DataFrame for performance and calculates the total number of observations and the baseline CRC rate.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Feature Reduction
# MAGIC Having the outcome variable is essential for calculating feature importance metrics like risk ratios and mutual information. The prefixing ensures clarity and avoids conflicts when integrating these features with other domains. Caching significantly speeds up subsequent operations, which is important for iterative analysis.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - **`Loaded {total_rows:,} visit history observations`**: Should match the cohort size (831,397).

# MAGIC ### STEP 2 - Calculate Risk Ratios for Binary Features
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell identifies all binary (flag) features and calculates several key metrics for each: prevalence (percentage of patients with the feature), CRC rate with and without the feature, the risk ratio (RR) comparing these rates, and an impact score. The impact score balances prevalence with the magnitude of the risk ratio, prioritizing features that are both common and strongly associated with CRC.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Feature Reduction
# MAGIC Risk ratios provide a clinically interpretable measure of a feature's predictive power. Features with high risk ratios, especially when combined with reasonable prevalence, are strong candidates for retention. The impact score helps to systematically prioritize features, ensuring that both rare, high-risk indicators and more common, moderate-risk indicators are considered.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - **`Top Risk Ratio Features`**: Look for features with RRs significantly greater than 1.0, indicating increased risk.
# MAGIC - **`Prevalence`**: Observe how common these high-RR features are.
# MAGIC - **`Impact`**: This score helps rank features by their overall contribution to risk stratification. For example, `visit_engaged_primary_care_flag` has an RR of 2.55 and an impact of 0.2275.

# MAGIC ### STEP 3 - Analyze Count Features and Missing Patterns
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell analyzes continuous features (visit counts, days, scores) by calculating distribution statistics (mean, median, percentiles), the percentage of zero values (zero-inflation), and their correlation with the `FUTURE_CRC_EVENT` outcome. It also examines missing patterns in `days_since` features, which are informative for "never had visit" scenarios.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Feature Reduction
# MAGIC Understanding the distribution and correlation of continuous features helps identify those with strong linear relationships to the outcome. Zero-inflation is particularly important for utilization data, as it indicates the proportion of patients who did not experience a specific event. Distinct handling of `count=0` versus `days_since=NULL` is crucial for models like XGBoost.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - **`Top Correlated Count Features`**: Look for features with higher absolute correlation values.
# MAGIC - **`Zero%`**: High percentages indicate rare events, which can still be highly predictive.
# MAGIC - **`Visit types by frequency (from days_since patterns)`**: The `missing_rate` for `days_since` features indicates the proportion of patients who *never* had that type of visit within the lookback. For example, `visit_days_since_last_gi` has a 97.9% missing rate, meaning very few patients saw a GI specialist.

# MAGIC ### STEP 4 - Calculate Mutual Information on Stratified Sample
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell creates a stratified sample of the dataset (keeping all positive CRC cases and sampling negative cases to a maximum of 100,000 rows) to efficiently calculate Mutual Information (MI) between features and the `FUTURE_CRC_EVENT` outcome. MI captures both linear and non-linear relationships, providing a robust measure of feature importance. Null values in `days_since` features are imputed with -999 to represent "never had visit," while other nulls are imputed with 0.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Feature Reduction
# MAGIC Mutual Information is a powerful non-parametric metric that can detect complex relationships that correlation or risk ratios might miss. Stratified sampling makes MI calculation feasible on large datasets while preserving the rare outcome signal. Features with higher MI scores are more informative about the outcome.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - **`Sampled {len(df_sample):,} rows for MI calculation`**: Confirms the sample size (102,959 rows).
# MAGIC - **`Sample CRC rate`**: Should be higher than the baseline due to stratification (0.0314).
# MAGIC - **`Top Mutual Information Features`**: Look for features with MI scores > 0.01 (strong signal) or between 0.001-0.01 (moderate signal). `visit_days_since_last_gi` (MI=0.0261) and `visit_days_since_last_inpatient` (MI=0.0199) are strong indicators.

# MAGIC ### STEP 5 - Apply Clinical Filters
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell merges the Mutual Information scores, risk ratios, prevalence, impact scores, and missing rates into a single DataFrame. It then applies clinical domain knowledge filters:
# MAGIC - **`MUST_KEEP`**: A predefined list of critical features (e.g., direct symptom burden, crisis care patterns) that are retained regardless of their statistical metrics.
# MAGIC - **`REMOVE`**: Features with extremely high missing rates (e.g., >98% for `days_since` features) are automatically removed if they are deemed too sparse to be useful.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Feature Reduction
# MAGIC Combining statistical metrics with clinical expertise ensures that the final feature set is not only statistically robust but also clinically meaningful and interpretable. This step prevents the accidental removal of rare but highly significant clinical indicators and prunes overly sparse or redundant features.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - **`Must-keep features`**: The number of features explicitly protected (7 in this case).
# MAGIC - **`Removing {len(REMOVE)} very rare features`**: Confirms if any features were removed due to extreme sparsity. In this run, `0` features were removed, indicating that the existing `days_since` features, despite high missing rates, are considered valuable enough to be retained for further selection.

# MAGIC ### STEP 6 - Select Optimal Features - Balanced Approach
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### 🔍 What This Cell Does
# MAGIC This cell implements a balanced feature selection strategy. It groups features by visit type (e.g., GI, ED, inpatient, outpatient, PCP) and applies tiered rules:
# MAGIC - **High-priority types (GI, ED, inpatient)**: Keep the top 2 features based on Mutual Information.
# MAGIC - **Common visits (outpatient, PCP)**: Prioritize flag features if prevalent (>10% prevalence), otherwise select the best MI feature.
# MAGIC - **Other types**: Select the single best feature by MI.
# MAGIC This approach ensures representation across different care settings while preventing over-representation of certain feature types (e.g., too many recency features). It also ensures that all `MUST_KEEP` features are included.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Why This Matters for Feature Reduction
# MAGIC A balanced selection prevents multicollinearity and ensures that the final feature set is diverse, capturing different aspects of healthcare utilization without redundancy. It combines statistical strength with clinical interpretability, leading to a more robust and efficient model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### What to Watch For
# MAGIC - **`Feature type balance`**: Observe the distribution of selected flags, counts/visits, and recency features.

### STEP 7 - Create Composite Features and Save

#### 🔍 What This Cell Does
This cell engineers five new, clinically meaningful composite features:
- `visit_gi_symptoms_no_specialist`: Identifies a care gap where patients have GI symptoms but no GI specialist visits.
- `visit_frequent_ed_no_pcp`: Flags a crisis-only care pattern (frequent ED use without PCP engagement).
- `visit_acute_care_reliance`: Quantifies the ratio of acute care (ED/inpatient) to outpatient visits.
- `visit_complexity_category`: Categorizes patients into healthcare complexity levels (0-3) based on intensity score and visit patterns.
- `visit_recent_acute_care`: A flag for recent ED use or hospitalization, indicating urgency.
These composite features are added to the `selected_features` list, and the final reduced dataset is saved to `{trgt_cat}.clncl_ds.herald_eda_train_visit_features_reduced`. A final row count validation ensures data integrity.

#### Why This Matters for Feature Reduction
Creating composite features allows for the capture of complex clinical patterns and system failures that individual features might miss. These features are often highly predictive and provide a more nuanced understanding of patient risk. This final step consolidates the feature engineering, resulting in a parsimonious yet powerful set of features for model training.

#### What to Watch For
- **`Added {len(composite_features)} composite features`**: Confirms the number of new features (5).
- **`Final feature count`**: The total number of features in the reduced dataset (23).
- **`Reduction`**: The percentage reduction from the original feature set (43.9%).

# MAGIC 1.  **Comprehensive Feature Engineering**: We extracted an initial set of **41 features** covering acute care (ED, inpatient), routine care (outpatient, PCP), specialty engagement (GI specialists), GI symptom burden, and care continuity. This provides a holistic view of patient healthcare utilization.
# MAGIC 2.  **Robust Data Validation**: Each step of the feature gathering process included rigorous validation, ensuring data quality and integrity. A critical row count validation confirmed that **831,397 observations** were consistently processed throughout.
# MAGIC 3.  **In-depth Clinical Insights**: The analysis revealed significant care gaps and system failures within the screening-overdue cohort:
# MAGIC     *   **Primary Care Crisis**: **62.6%** of patients had no PCP visits in the past year, suggesting emergency care often substitutes for prevention.
# MAGIC     *   **GI Specialty Bottleneck**: Only **0.9%** of patients saw a GI specialist despite **8.2%** presenting with GI-related symptoms, indicating an **89% unmet need** for specialty evaluation.
# MAGIC     *   **Emergency Department Reliance**: **18.8%** of patients relied on the ED for healthcare, with **4.8%** having recent ED use (last 90 days).
# MAGIC 4.  **Data-Driven Feature Reduction**: Employing a balanced approach combining Risk Ratios, Mutual Information, and clinical domain knowledge, we successfully reduced the feature set from **41 to 23 features**, achieving a **43.9% reduction**. This optimized set retains the most predictive and interpretable signals.
# MAGIC 5.  **Clinically Meaningful Composites**: Five new composite features were engineered, such as `visit_gi_symptoms_no_specialist` (care gap indicator) and `visit_frequent_ed_no_pcp` (crisis care pattern), which capture complex clinical scenarios and enhance model interpretability.

# MAGIC ### Technical Excellence
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The implementation utilized Spark SQL for efficient distributed data processing, handling a large volume of raw encounter data (e.g., 19.8M ED/Inpatient and 308M outpatient encounters). Python with Pandas and scikit-learn was used for detailed statistical analysis and Mutual Information calculation on a stratified sample, demonstrating a hybrid approach for scalability and analytical depth. The use of clear data quality cutoffs and explicit validation steps throughout the notebook ensures the reliability of the generated features.

# MAGIC ### Deliverables
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The primary deliverable is the `herald_eda_train_visit_features_reduced` table, containing **23 optimized visit history features** for **831,397 patient-month observations**. This table is ready for integration into downstream CRC risk prediction models.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Next Steps
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The next phase involves integrating these refined visit history features with other feature domains (e.g., labs, medications, demographics) to build a comprehensive predictive model for CRC risk in the screening-overdue population. Further analysis will focus on model performance, interpretability, and the clinical utility of the identified high-risk patterns to guide targeted interventions.
