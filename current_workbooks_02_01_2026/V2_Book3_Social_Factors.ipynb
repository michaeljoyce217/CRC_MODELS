    "# Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction Model: Social Determinants Feature Engineering\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf What This Notebook Does\n\nThis notebook extracts and engineers features from **social history data** (smoking, alcohol, drug use) to support colorectal cancer (CRC) risk prediction. Unlike diagnosis codes or lab values, social factors present unique data quality challenges due to how they're documented in Epic EHR workflows.\n\n\n**The Epic Default Problem:** This notebook reveals a critical EHR data quality issue where Epic's workflow defaults create systematically biased social history data. We'll discover that 83% of patients marked \"never smoker\" actually includes unanswered defaults, creating an impossible biological relationship where \"never smokers\" have **higher** CRC rates than current smokers.\n\n**Why This Matters:** This analysis demonstrates how to detect and handle workflow artifacts that corrupt clinical data\u2014a crucial skill for healthcare ML practitioners.\n\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clinical Background and Motivation\n\n### The Problem: Social Factors and CRC Risk\n\nSocial and behavioral factors are **modifiable risk factors** for colorectal cancer, meaning patients can change them to reduce risk. Understanding these associations helps with:\n- **Risk stratification**: Identifying high-risk patients for early screening\n- **Prevention counseling**: Targeting interventions to those who need them most\n- **Resource allocation**: Focusing limited healthcare resources effectively\n\n**Established Clinical Associations**:\n- **Tobacco use**: Current/former smokers have 1.5-2x higher CRC risk than never smokers\n- **Pack-year exposure**: Shows dose-response relationship (>20 pack-years = 2-3x risk)\n  - *Pack-years = (packs per day) \u00d7 (years smoked)*\n  - Example: 1 pack/day for 20 years = 20 pack-years\n- **Heavy alcohol**: >14 drinks/week associated with 1.5x increased risk\n- **Cessation timing**: Risk decays slowly over 10-15 years after quitting\n\n### The Epic Workflow Artifact Problem\n\nHere's where things get interesting. Social history documentation suffers from a **critical Epic EHR design flaw** that creates systematically biased data:\n\n**The Default Bias:**\n- Epic's social history workflow defaults `SMOKING_TOB_USE_C = 4` (\"Never Smoker\") when providers skip the field\n- During time-limited visits, providers often click through social history screens quickly\n- **Result**: 83% of our cohort marked \"never smoker\"\u2014but most are **unanswered defaults**, not confirmed non-smokers\n- This creates an **inverted risk relationship**: \n  - \"Never smokers\": 0.375% CRC rate\n  - Current smokers: 0.269% CRC rate (lower!)\n- The \"never\" category is polluted with true missingness masquerading as negative responses\n\n**Why This Matters for ML:**\nWhen your largest category (83% of data) is corrupted by workflow defaults, any model trained on it will learn the *wrong* patterns. This is worse than missing data\u2014it's **systematically misleading data**.\n\n**Former Smoker Data Catastrophe:**\n- **Expected prevalence**: 20-25% (U.S. population statistics)\n- **Actual in our data**: 0.01% (80 out of 858K observations)\n- This category is essentially **missing from our dataset**\n\n**Pack-Years: High Signal, High Missingness:**\n- Only 9.80% have quantitative pack-years data (84,140 out of 858K)\n- Among those with data: clear dose-response relationship visible\n- >20 pack-years: 0.79% CRC rate (2.2x baseline of 0.36%)\n- But **90.20% missingness** severely limits utility\n\n### Data Availability Constraints\n\n**Critical limitation**: The `clarity` and `clarity_cur` tables (where social history lives) only go back to **July 1, 2021**.\n\n**Impact on our study**:\n- Study period: January 2023 - December 2024\n- Maximum possible lookback: ~2.5 years (not the 5 years often cited in research)\n- For observations in early 2023, we have <2 years of history\n- Cannot assess long-term smoking history for early cohort entries\n- This further reduces already-limited social history data quality\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nSmoking-related CRC risk accumulates over decades. A 2-year window misses most of the relevant exposure history, especially for former smokers who quit >2 years ago.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Study Design and Methodology\n\n### 2.1 Patient-Month Observation Structure\n\nWe maintain strict alignment with the base cohort design:\n\n- **858,311 observations** from 231,948 unique patients\n- **Composite key**: `PAT_ID + END_DTTM` (patient + observation month)\n- **Temporal integrity**: All social history must be from \u2264 `END_DTTM` (no future data leakage)\n- **No imputation**: Missing values preserved as `NULL` for XGBoost to handle natively\n- **Row count validation**: Must output exactly 858,311 rows (1:1 with cohort)\n\n**Why Composite Keys Matter:**\nEach row represents a patient at a specific point in time. The same patient appears multiple times (once per month). Features must reflect what was *known at that moment*\u2014not future information.\n\n### 2.2 Temporal Considerations\n\n**Lookback Window: 3 years (adjusted for data availability)**\n\nWe want 3 years of social history, but the `clarity` tables only exist from July 1, 2021 onward. So for each observation, we calculate the effective lookback as the later of:\n- 3 years before the observation date (1095 days)\n- July 1, 2021 (the data floor)\n\nThis means:\n- **Early observations** (e.g., March 2023) get ~20 months of history\n- **Later observations** (e.g., December 2024) get the full 36 months\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nSmoking-related CRC risk accumulates over decades. A 2-year window misses most relevant exposure history, especially for former smokers who quit >2 years ago. This data constraint further reduces already-limited social history quality.\n\n### 2.3 Feature Engineering Philosophy\n\n**Three types of features we'll create:**\n\n1. **Status flags** (binary): Current smoker? Heavy drinker?\n2. **Quantitative measures** (continuous): Pack-years, drinks per week\n3. **Temporal features** (recency): Days since last documentation\n\n**Why Multiple Feature Types:**\nDifferent ML algorithms prefer different representations. XGBoost can handle all three and will learn which are most predictive.\n\n**What We're Looking For:**\n- Clear dose-response relationships (more exposure = higher risk)\n- Temporal patterns (recent vs distant history)\n- Interaction effects (smoking + alcohol)\n- Documentation quality as a proxy for healthcare engagement\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d What to Expect in This Notebook\n\n**The Journey:**\n1. Extract smoking status with temporal respect (Cell 2)\n2. Add quantitative pack-years data (Cell 3)\n3. Incorporate alcohol and drug use (Cell 4)\n4. Validate data quality (Cells 5-10)\n5. Make final feature selection decision (Cell 11)\n\n**The Outcome:**\nWe'll discover that Epic workflow artifacts have corrupted the data beyond repair, leading to the decision to **exclude all 31 features**. This is a valuable lesson: sometimes the right answer is \"this data isn't usable.\"\n\n**Learning Objectives:**\n- How to detect and diagnose data quality issues\n- When to exclude features despite clinical relevance\n- How workflow design affects data integrity\n- Alternative data sources for the same clinical concepts\n- The importance of documenting negative findings\n\n\n\n\n \n"

    "## \ud83d\udd0d What This Cell Does\n\nThis cell extracts **smoking status** from Epic's `social_hx` table and creates binary flags for each category (current, former, never, unknown). It respects temporal boundaries\u2014only using social history documented **before or on** each observation's `END_DTTM`.\n\n**Key Challenge:** Epic defaults to \"Never Smoker\" when providers skip the field, creating massive data corruption where 83% are marked \"never smoker\"\u2014but most are unanswered defaults, not confirmed non-smokers.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters Clinically\n\nSmoking is one of the strongest modifiable CRC risk factors:\n- **Current smokers**: 1.5-2x higher risk\n- **Former smokers**: Risk persists 10-15 years after quitting\n- **Pack-years**: Dose-response relationship (more smoking = higher risk)\n\nHowever, documentation quality determines feature utility. If workflow artifacts corrupt the data, features become anti-predictive.\n\n---\n\n## What This Code Does\n\n**Temporal Boundaries:**\nThe query uses a 3-year lookback window but can't look before July 2021 (when `clarity` tables begin). Uses `GREATEST()` to take the later of:\n- 3 years before observation date (1095 days)\n- July 1, 2021 (data floor)\n\n**Most Recent Status:**\nWhen patients have multiple assessments in the lookback window, we use the most recent one via `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY PAT_ID, END_DTTM ORDER BY CONTACT_DATE DESC)`.\n\n**Binary Flags:**\nCreates separate flags for each status (current, former, never, unknown) rather than one categorical variable. Tree-based models handle these more efficiently.\n\n**Documentation Quality:**\nTracks whether smoking was documented, how recently, and within specific time windows. Missing data isn't random\u2014patients with recent documentation may be more engaged with care.\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch For\n\n**Data Leakage:**\n- \u274c **Wrong:** `CONTACT_DATE > END_DTTM` (uses future data)\n- \u2705 **Right:** `CONTACT_DATE <= END_DTTM` (historical only)\n\n**Missing vs Zero:**\n- `NULL` = No documentation exists\n- `0` = Documented as \"never smoker\" or \"not current\"\n\nXGBoost handles NULLs natively by learning optimal split directions.\n\n**Epic Default Problem:**\nWhen 83% are \"never smokers,\" ask: Is this real? The inverted risk relationship (never smokers have **higher** CRC rates: 0.375% vs 0.269% for current smokers) proves the data is corrupted.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Output\n\n\u2713 Temp1 created: 858,311 rows, 98.13% with smoking documentation\n\n\n**Validation:**\n- \u2705 Row count matches cohort exactly\n- \u26a0\ufe0f 98.13% have documentation, but most is \"never\" (likely defaults)\n- 1.87% have truly missing data\n\n---"

    "## \ud83d\udd0d What This Cell Does\n\nThis cell adds **quantitative pack-years data** to enhance the basic smoking flags from Cell 2. Pack-years is the gold standard metric for cumulative smoking exposure\u2014it captures both intensity (packs per day) and duration (years smoked).\n\n**Formula:** Pack-years = (Packs per Day) \u00d7 (Years Smoked)\n\nExample: 1 pack/day for 20 years = 20 pack-years\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters Clinically\n\n**Clinical Risk Thresholds:**\n- **>20 pack-years**: 2-3x increased CRC risk\n- **>40 pack-years**: 3-4x increased CRC risk\n- **Risk persists**: Elevated risk continues 10-15 years after quitting\n\nPack-years captures cumulative carcinogen exposure better than simple \"current/former/never\" categories. A patient who smoked 2 packs/day for 30 years (60 pack-years) has vastly different risk than someone who smoked occasionally for 5 years (2 pack-years)\u2014but both might be labeled \"former smoker.\"\n\n---\n\n## What This Code Does\n\n**Data Source:**\n`clarity.TOB_PACKYEARS_DATA` contains detailed smoking quantification:\n- `TOB_HX_PACKS_PER_DAY_NUM`: Daily cigarette consumption\n- `TOB_HX_START_DATE`: When patient started smoking\n- `TOB_HX_END_DATE`: When patient quit (NULL if current smoker)\n- `TOB_HX_YEARS_NUM`: Total years smoked (sometimes recorded directly)\n\n**Pack-Years Calculation Strategy:**\nThe code tries multiple methods because data may be incomplete:\n1. **Former smoker with complete dates**: Calculate from start to quit date\n2. **Current smoker** (no quit date): Calculate from start to observation date\n3. **Fallback**: Use the recorded years if available\n\nThen multiply by packs per day to get pack-years.\n\n**Data Quality Filters:**\n- Values >200 pack-years \u2192 NULL (e.g., 12,321 is clearly a data entry error)\n- Negative values \u2192 NULL (impossible)\n\nThese prevent extreme outliers from corrupting the model.\n\n**Clinical Threshold Flags:**\nCreates binary indicators for key pack-year thresholds:\n- `HEAVY_SMOKER_20PY`: >20 pack-years (significantly elevated risk)\n- `HEAVY_SMOKER_30PY`: >30 pack-years (high risk)\n- `HEAVY_SMOKER_40PY`: >40 pack-years (very high risk)\n\n**Recent Quitter Flags:**\nFormer smokers who quit recently still have elevated risk:\n- `QUIT_WITHIN_10YRS`: Risk still elevated\n- `QUIT_WITHIN_5YRS`: Highest risk among former smokers\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch For\n\n**The Missing Data Trade-off:**\nPack-years has excellent signal quality but **90.20% missingness** (only 84,140 out of 858K observations have values). XGBoost handles missing data natively by learning optimal split directions, so this sparsity becomes informative rather than problematic.\n\n**Why LEFT JOIN:**\nPreserves all 858,311 observations from temp1. Patients without pack-years data get NULL values, which XGBoost can work with. An INNER JOIN would drop 96% of our cohort.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Output\n\n\u2713 Temp2 created: 84,140 rows with pack-years Average: 5.26, Median: 0.00 Heavy smokers (>20PY): 8,484\n\n\n**What this means:**\n- \u2705 Row count still matches cohort (858,311 total)\n- \ud83d\udcca Only 9.80% have pack-years data (84,140 / 858,311)\n- \ud83d\udcc8 Among those with data: Average 5.26 pack-years, median 0.00 (right-skewed)\n- \u26a0\ufe0f 8,484 heavy smokers (&gt;20 pack-years) = 0.99% of total cohort\n\n**Why median = 0.00?**\nThe median is calculated across ALL rows (including NULLs treated as 0), not just those with pack-years data. This shows how sparse the data is.\n\n---"

    "## \ud83d\udcca Conclusion\n\n**What We Found:**\n- 858,311 rows maintained (matches cohort \u2713)\n- 84,140 observations have pack-years data (9.80%)\n- 8,484 heavy smokers identified (&gt;20 pack-years)\n\n**The Pack-Years Paradox:**\n- Among the 9.80% with data: Median 21.5 pack-years (excellent signal quality)\n- Clear dose-response: >20 pack-years = 1.9x CRC risk\n- **But:** 90.20% missingness makes population-level modeling unreliable\n- **Conclusion:** High-quality signal in a sparse feature\n\nAlthough the median presents as 0.00, this is including the null values. When we analyze just the 84,140 who have pack-years data (Cell 8), the median jumps to 21.5 pack-years\u2014showing clear dose-response relationship with CRC risk. The feature has excellent signal quality for the 10% who have it, but 90% get no additional information beyond basic smoking flags.\n\n**Next Step:**\nCell 4 adds alcohol and drug use data, then creates composite risk scores combining multiple lifestyle factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "## \ud83d\udd0d What This Cell Does\n\nThis cell adds **alcohol and drug use data** plus **passive smoke exposure**, then creates **composite risk scores** that combine multiple lifestyle factors into single predictive features.\n\n**Enhancement:** While Cells 2-3 focused on smoking, Cell 4 completes the social determinants picture by adding alcohol, drugs, and passive smoke\u2014then synthesizing them into composite scores.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters Clinically\n\n**Additional Risk Factors:**\n- **Heavy alcohol** (>14 drinks/week): 1.5x increased CRC risk\n- **Illicit drug use**: May indicate healthcare avoidance patterns\n- **Passive smoke**: Secondhand smoke has modest CRC risk increase\n\n**Composite Scores:**\nIndividual factors are useful, but **combinations** can be more predictive. A patient with heavy smoking + heavy drinking + passive smoke exposure has compounded risk beyond individual factors.\n\n---\n\n## What This Code Does\n\n**Data Source:**\nThe same `social_hx` table contains:\n- `ALCOHOL_USE_C`: Categorical (1=Yes, 2=No, 5=Not Asked, 6=Declined)\n- `ALCOHOL_OZ_PER_WK`: Quantitative consumption (ounces per week)\n- `ILL_DRUG_USER_C`: Drug use flag (same coding as alcohol)\n- `PASSIVE_SMOKE_EXPOSURE_C`: Secondhand smoke (1=Yes, 2=Maybe, 3=No, 4=Unsure)\n\n**Heavy Drinking Threshold:**\nThe clinical threshold of **>14 drinks/week** (~2 drinks/day) is based on NIAAA guidelines and epidemiological studies linking this level to increased cancer risk.\n\n**Composite Scores Created:**\n\n1. **SOCIAL_DOCUMENTATION_SCORE (0-4):** Counts how many social factors are documented\u2014proxy for healthcare engagement\n2. **LIFESTYLE_RISK_SCORE (0-4):** Counts actual risk factors present (heavy smoking, heavy drinking, drug use, passive smoke)\n3. **HIGH_RISK_SMOKING_HISTORY:** Binary flag for patients with highest smoking-related CRC risk\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch For\n\n**Epic Coding:**\nAlcohol and drug fields use: 1=Yes, 2=No, 5=Not Asked, 6=Declined. We treat 2/5/6 as \"no use\" but distinguish NULL (no documentation) from 0 (documented non-use).\n\n**Passive Smoke Ambiguity:**\nEpic codes as 1=Yes, 2=Maybe, 3=No, 4=Unsure. We conservatively group Yes/Maybe/Unsure as \"exposed\" for cancer risk modeling.\n\n**Documentation vs Risk:**\n`SOCIAL_DOCUMENTATION_SCORE` measures completeness (healthcare engagement proxy).\n`LIFESTYLE_RISK_SCORE` measures actual clinical risk factors.\n\n---\n\n## Expected Output\n\n- \u2713 Temp2 created: \n- 84,140 rows with pack-years \n- Average: 5.26, \n- Median: 0.00 \n- Heavy smokers (>20PY): 8,484\n- Row count: 858,311 (matches cohort \u2713)"

The 83% \"never smoker\" rate includes unanswered defaults, creating inverted risk relationships that prove data corruption. Heavy drinker prevalence (0.69%) is too low to meaningfully improve model performance despite showing expected 1.89x relative risk.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nCells 5-10 perform systematic validation to quantify these data quality issues, culminating in Cell 11's evidence-based decision to exclude all 31 features rather than introduce anti-predictive noise into the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "## \ud83d\udd0d What This Cell Does\n\nThis cell performs **row count validation** to ensure we haven't accidentally duplicated or lost observations during the complex joins in Cells 2-4.\n\n**The Check:** Compares final table row count against original cohort to confirm exact match (858,311 rows).\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nEvery observation represents a real patient-month. Losing rows means missing patients; duplicating rows means counting patients multiple times\u2014both corrupt model training.\n\n**The Composite Key:** `PAT_ID + END_DTTM` means each patient can appear multiple times (once per month), but each patient-month combination must be unique.\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch For\n\n**Common Causes of Mismatches:**\n- INNER JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN (drops patients without social history)\n- Missing composite key in JOIN (creates Cartesian products)\n- Duplicate records in source tables\n- Overly aggressive WHERE clauses\n\n**Why This Catches Problems Early:**\nEasier to debug here than after merging 10 other feature domains in the final model table.\n"

    "## \ud83d\udd0d What This Cell Does\n\nThis cell analyzes **data completeness** across all social factors to quantify missingness patterns. It calculates what percentage of the 858K observations have documentation for each factor (smoking, pack-years, alcohol, drugs, passive smoke).\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n**Missing Data \u2260 Random:**\nIn EHR data, missingness patterns are informative. High missingness can indicate:\n- Workflow gaps (providers skip certain fields)\n- Clinical irrelevance (not asked for low-risk patients)\n- Data quality issues (fields not properly captured)\n\n**The Missingness Trade-off:**\nFeatures with very high missingness (>95%) are typically excluded unless they have exceptional signal quality when present. For example, \"time since last pancreatic cancer diagnosis\" might be 99% missing but highly predictive for the 1% who have it. XGBoost handles missing data natively by learning optimal split directions, so sparsity becomes informative rather than problematic.\n\n**Pack-years is a perfect example:** 90.20% missing, but among the 9.80% with data, it shows clear dose-response relationship with CRC risk.\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch For\n\n**Documentation vs Actual Values:**\nThis cell checks two levels:\n1. **Has documentation** (field was filled out at all)\n2. **Has meaningful value** (not just \"not asked\" or \"declined\")\n\nFor example, 98.13% have smoking documentation, but only 9.80% have quantitative pack-years data.\n\n**Expected Patterns:**\n- Smoking: High documentation (>90%) due to Epic workflow\n- Pack-years: Low (<10%) because requires detailed assessment\n- Alcohol/drugs: Moderate (70-90%) depending on clinical setting\n- Passive smoke: Low (<20%) as it's often skipped"

    "## \ud83d\udd0d What This Cell Does\n\nThis cell examines the **smoking status distribution** to reveal the Epic workflow default problem. It calculates what percentage of observations fall into each smoking category (never, current, former) and quantifies heavy smoking prevalence.\n\n**The Critical Finding:** 83.48% marked \"never smoker\"\u2014but this includes both confirmed non-smokers AND unanswered Epic defaults, creating the data corruption problem.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n**The Epic Default Artifact:**\nWhen providers skip the smoking field during intake, Epic automatically defaults `SMOKING_TOB_USE_C = 4` (\"Never Smoker\"). In time-limited visits, providers often click through social history screens quickly, meaning most \"never smoker\" entries are actually **missing data masquerading as negative responses**.\n\n**Expected vs Actual:**\n- Expected never smokers: 30-40% (CRC screening age population)\n- Actual in our data: 83.48% (716,495 observations)\n- The excess ~40% are likely unanswered Epic defaults\n\n**Former Smoker Catastrophe:**\n- Expected: 40-50% (largest category for ages 50-75)\n- Actual: 0.01% (80 observations out of 858K)\n- This should be our **largest** category but is essentially missing\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch For\n\n**Mutually Exclusive Categories:**\nThe smoking status flags (NEVER, CURRENT, FORMER) should sum to the total documented observations. Any discrepancy indicates data quality issues.\n\n**Heavy Smoker Prevalence:**\n- 0.99% with >20 pack-years (8,484 observations)\n- 0.62% with >30 pack-years (5,308 observations)\n- These low percentages reflect the 90.20% missingness in pack-years data\n\n**Documentation Quality:**\n98.13% have \"smoking documentation,\" but this includes Epic defaults. True documentation (with quantitative data like pack-years) is only 9.80%.\n"

    "## \ud83d\udd0d What This Cell Does\n\nThis cell analyzes the **pack-years distribution** among the 9.80% of observations that have quantitative smoking data. It calculates summary statistics (min, median, max, mean) and counts how many patients exceed clinical risk thresholds (>20, >30, >40 pack-years).\n\n**The Key Finding:** Among the 16,566 unique patients with pack-years data, the median is 21.5 pack-years with clear dose-response relationship\u2014but this represents only 7.1% of the 231,948 unique patients in the cohort.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n**Pack-Years as Gold Standard:**\nPack-years = (packs per day) \u00d7 (years smoked) is the clinical gold standard for quantifying cumulative smoking exposure. It captures both intensity and duration, making it superior to simple \"current/former/never\" categories.\n\n**Clinical Risk Thresholds:**\n- **>20 pack-years:** 2-3x increased CRC risk (8,484 patients = 3.6% of cohort)\n- **>30 pack-years:** 3-4x increased CRC risk (5,308 patients = 2.3% of cohort)\n- **>40 pack-years:** 4-5x increased CRC risk (3,462 patients = 1.5% of cohort)\n\n**The Signal vs Sparsity Trade-off:**\nWhen present, pack-years shows clear dose-response relationship. The median of 21.5 among documented patients suggests this population skews toward heavier smokers (as expected\u2014providers document pack-years when clinically relevant). However, 90.20% missingness means XGBoost will learn from only 9.80% of observations.\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch For\n\n**Why Filter to PACK_YEARS > 0:**\nThe query includes `WHERE PACK_YEARS IS NOT NULL AND PACK_YEARS > 0` because:\n- Some patients have smoking documentation but zero calculated pack-years (recent initiators, data entry errors)\n- We want statistics on actual exposure, not just \"has any smoking data\"\n- This gives us the distribution among true smokers with quantifiable history\n\n**Unique Patients vs Observations:**\n- 16,566 unique patients have pack-years data\n- But remember: our table has 858,311 observations (patient-months)\n- Same patient appears multiple times with same pack-years value\n- The 84,140 observations with pack-years (from Cell 3) represent these 16,566 patients across multiple months\n\n**The 200 Pack-Year Cap:**\nCell 3 filtered `PACK_YEARS > 200` as data errors. The max of 200.0 here confirms this filter worked\u2014we're not seeing the 12,321 pack-year outliers that indicate data entry mistakes (someone typed \"123.21\" as \"12321\").\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "## \ud83d\udd0d What This Cell Does\n\nThis cell performs the **critical validation step**: analyzing CRC outcome rates across all social factor categories to determine if they show expected clinical relationships or reveal data corruption artifacts.\n\n**The Smoking Paradox Test:** If Epic defaults have corrupted the \"never smoker\" category, we should see an inverted risk relationship where \"never smokers\" have higher CRC rates than current smokers\u2014which is biologically impossible.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Analysis is Critical\n\n**Expected Clinical Relationships:**\n- **Current smokers**: Should have highest CRC rates (1.5-2x baseline)\n- **Former smokers**: Intermediate rates (risk persists 10-15 years)\n- **Never smokers**: Lowest rates (baseline risk)\n- **Pack-years**: Clear dose-response (>20 pack-years = 2-3x risk)\n- **Heavy alcohol**: 1.5x increased risk vs non-drinkers\n\n**The Epic Default Test:**\nIf 83% \"never smokers\" includes unanswered Epic defaults, this corrupted category should show:\n- Higher CRC rates than expected (includes high-risk patients marked as \"never\")\n- Inverted relationship with current smokers\n- Loss of dose-response relationship\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nFeatures that show inverted relationships are **anti-predictive**\u2014they make the model worse, not better. Better to exclude them entirely than introduce systematic bias.\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch For\n\n**Biological Plausibility:**\n- Current > Former > Never smokers (expected hierarchy)\n- Pack-years dose-response (higher exposure = higher risk)\n- Alcohol threshold effects (heavy > moderate > none)\n\n**Data Quality Red Flags:**\n- Inverted smoking relationships (never > current)\n- Missing dose-response patterns\n- Implausibly low prevalence in high-risk categories\n\n**Statistical Significance:**\nWith 858K observations, even small differences are statistically significant.

    "## \ud83d\udd0d What This Cell Does\n\nThis cell quantifies the **prevalence of non-smoking social factors** (alcohol, drugs, passive smoke) and analyzes the **composite risk score distribution** to complete our data quality assessment before the final exclusion decision.\n\n**The Final Piece:** While Cells 7-9 exposed the smoking data corruption, Cell 10 evaluates whether alcohol, drug use, or passive smoke exposure might salvage some predictive value from the social factors domain.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Analysis Matters\n\n**Completing the Picture:**\nAfter discovering the smoking inversion problem, we need to assess whether other social factors show:\n- Sufficient prevalence to impact model performance\n- Expected clinical relationships with CRC risk\n- Data quality adequate for reliable prediction\n\n**Composite Risk Scores:**\nThe `LIFESTYLE_RISK_SCORE` (0-4 scale) combines multiple risk factors. If most patients score 0-1, the feature lacks discriminative power. If scores correlate with CRC rates, it might be worth preserving despite individual factor limitations.\n\n**Clinical Context:**\n- **Heavy drinking** (>14 drinks/week): 1.5x CRC risk, but low prevalence expected\n- **Drug use**: May indicate healthcare avoidance, delayed screening\n- **Passive smoke**: Modest risk increase, often underreported\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch For\n\n**Prevalence Thresholds:**\nFeatures affecting <1% of patients rarely improve model performance unless they have exceptional signal strength (>3x relative risk). With 858K observations, even small effects are statistically significant\u2014focus on clinical significance.\n\n**Documentation Patterns:**\n- Alcohol: 95.80% documented vs 39.96% reporting use (reasonable)\n- Drugs: 94.44% documented vs 6.51% reporting use (expected low rate)\n- Passive smoke: 11.25% documented vs 38.73% reporting exposure (severely underassessed)\n\n**Risk Score Distribution:**\nIf 90%+ have risk score 0-1, the composite feature lacks discriminative power. Look for meaningful spread across the 0-4 scale.\n\n---"

    "## \ud83d\udcca Conclusion\n\n**Prevalence Results:**\n- Alcohol users: 39.96% of documented (328,592 observations)\n- Heavy drinkers: 0.69% of total cohort (5,881 observations)\n- Drug users: 6.51% of documented (52,796 observations)\n- Passive smoke exposed: 38.73% of documented (37,390 observations)\n\n**Risk Score Distribution:**\n- Score 0 (no risk factors): 88.7% (761,309 observations)\n- Score 1 (one risk factor): 10.5% (89,873 observations)\n- Score 2 (two risk factors): 0.8% (6,715 observations)\n- Score 3+ (multiple risk factors): 0.05% (414 observations)\n\n**What This Reveals:**\nThe composite risk scores show extreme skew toward zero\u201489% of patients have no documented lifestyle risk factors. This reflects the Epic default problem rather than true risk distribution. Heavy drinking shows the expected 1.89x relative risk (0.68% vs 0.36% baseline), but affects only 0.69% of the cohort\u2014too sparse to meaningfully improve model performance.\n\n**The Documentation Paradox:**\nWhile 95.80% have alcohol documentation and 94.44% have drug documentation, most responses are likely Epic defaults (\"No\" when providers skip fields). The 38.73% passive smoke exposure among the 11.25% documented suggests this field is severely underassessed\u2014providers only ask when clinically relevant.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\nEven combining all social factors into composite scores, 89% score zero due to Epic defaults. The 0.05% with multiple risk factors (414 observations) is too small for reliable modeling. The data corruption in smoking (the strongest CRC risk factor) overwhelms any signal from alcohol or other factors.\n\n**Next Step:**\nCell 11 synthesizes all findings to make the evidence-based decision to exclude all 31 social factor features, documenting why this is scientifically sound despite the clinical importance of these risk factors.\n"

    "## \ud83d\udd0d What This Cell Does\n\nThis cell makes the **final evidence-based decision** to exclude all 31 social factor features from the CRC risk model. It synthesizes findings from Cells 5-10 to document why exclusion is scientifically sound despite the clinical importance of smoking and alcohol as CRC risk factors.\n\n**The Critical Decision:** After discovering Epic workflow defaults have created inverted risk relationships (never smokers have **higher** CRC rates than current smokers), we exclude all social factors rather than introduce anti-predictive noise into the model.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Decision Matters\n\n**Scientific Integrity vs Clinical Relevance:**\nSmoking and alcohol are established CRC risk factors in the literature, but our EHR data is corrupted beyond repair. The responsible approach is to document the limitations and exclude flawed features rather than use them because \"they should be predictive.\"\n\n**The Epic Default Problem:**\n- 83% marked \"never smoker\" includes unanswered Epic defaults\n- Creates inverted relationship: never smokers (0.375% CRC) > current smokers (0.269% CRC)\n- Former smokers essentially missing (0.01% vs expected 20-25%)\n- Pack-years has signal but 90.20% missingness\n\n**Feature Economy Principle:**\nWith 300+ features already available from other domains (demographics, diagnoses, labs, vitals), adding 31 noisy features reduces model performance. Better to have fewer, higher-quality features than many corrupted ones.\n\n---\n\n## What This Code Does\n\n**Data Quality Summary:**\nCalculates final statistics on actual smoking history (14.0%), pack-years availability (9.8%), and heavy drinking prevalence (0.69%) to quantify the sparsity problem.\n\n**Decision Documentation:**\nProvides clear rationale for exclusion with specific evidence:\n1. Inverted smoking relationships prove Epic default corruption\n2. Pack-years signal exists but 90% missing limits utility\n3. Heavy drinking affects <1% with weak signal strength\n4. Alternative data sources available (ICD codes, labs)\n\n### Better Alternatives for Substance-Related Risk\n\n**ICD-10 Diagnosis Codes (No Missing Data Issues):**\n- `F17.210`: Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated\n- `F10.20`: Alcohol use disorder, moderate\n- **Advantage:** Only documented when clinically relevant, not subject to Epic defaults\n\n**Laboratory Biomarkers (Objective Measures):**\n- AST/ALT ratio >2.0: Suggests alcohol-related liver damage\n- GGT elevation: Sensitive marker for chronic alcohol use\n- **Advantage:** Physiological evidence of substance impact\n\n**Procedure Codes (Behavioral Evidence):**\n- CPT 99406/99407: Smoking cessation counseling\n- **Advantage:** Indicates documented substance use requiring intervention\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch For\n\n**The Exclusion Paradox:**\nThis decision excludes clinically important risk factors due to data quality issues. This is **good science**\u2014using flawed data because \"it should work\" leads to worse models than excluding it entirely.\n\n**Documentation Value:**\nThis analysis isn't wasted effort. It:\n- Identifies Epic workflow improvements needed\n- Establishes baseline for future data quality monitoring\n- Demonstrates alternative approaches for substance use risk\n- Shows how to handle similar data quality decisions\n\n**Model Performance Impact:**\nExcluding these features likely **improves** model performance by removing anti-predictive noise. XGBoost would learn wrong patterns from the inverted smoking relationships.\n\n---"

    "markdown\nCopy\n## \ud83d\udcca Conclusion\n\n**Final Decision: Exclude All 31 Social Factor Features**\n\nAfter comprehensive analysis of 858,311 observations, we exclude all social factor features due to Epic workflow artifacts that have corrupted the data beyond repair.\n\n**The Smoking Inversion - Definitive Proof of Data Corruption:**\n- Never smokers: **0.375% CRC rate** (higher than baseline 0.36%)\n- Current smokers: **0.269% CRC rate** (lower than baseline)\n- This biologically impossible relationship proves Epic defaults have corrupted the \"never smoker\" category\n\n**The Missing Former Smoker Problem:**\n- Expected prevalence: 20-25% (U.S. population aged 50-75)\n- Actual prevalence: 0.01% (80 out of 858K observations)\n- The largest risk category is essentially missing from our dataset\n\n**Risk Score Distribution Reveals Systematic Bias:**\n- 88.7% have lifestyle risk score of 0 (no documented risk factors)\n- 10.5% have score of 1, 0.8% have score of 2\n- Only 0.05% have multiple risk factors (414 observations)\n- This extreme skew reflects Epic defaults, not true risk distribution\n\n**Pack-Years: Good Signal, Fatal Sparsity:**\n- Only 9.80% have quantitative data (84,140 observations)\n- Among those with data: median 21.5 pack-years, clear dose-response\n- But 90.20% missingness makes it unreliable for population-level modeling\n\n**Heavy Drinking: Expected Relationship, Insufficient Prevalence:**\n- Shows expected 1.89x relative risk (0.68% vs 0.36% baseline)\n- But affects only 0.69% of cohort (5,881 observations)\n- Too sparse to meaningfully improve model performance\n\n**Why Exclusion is Scientifically Sound:**\n1. **Anti-predictive features**: Inverted relationships make the model worse\n2. **Epic default corruption**: 83% \"never smokers\" includes unanswered defaults\n3. **Missing key category**: Former smokers (largest risk group) absent\n4. **Better alternatives exist**: ICD codes (F17.*, F10.*), lab values (AST/ALT), procedures\n5. **Feature economy**: 300+ features from other domains already available\n\n**Alternative Data Sources:**\n- **ICD-10 codes**: F17.* (tobacco disorder), F10.* (alcohol disorder) - documented when clinically relevant\n- **Laboratory markers**: AST/ALT ratios, GGT, MCV for alcohol-related organ damage\n- **Procedure codes**: Smoking cessation counseling, substance abuse treatment\n- **Medication proxies**: Varenicline, bupropion, naltrexone prescriptions\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nUsing corrupted data because \"it should be predictive\" is bad science. Better to exclude flawed features entirely than introduce systematic bias. This analysis documents the data quality issues and establishes the need for Epic workflow improvements.\n\n**Final Count: 0 of 31 features retained for modeling.**"
