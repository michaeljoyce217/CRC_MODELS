    "\n",
    "**In 3 sentences:**\n",
    "1. We extract vital signs features from **858K patient-month observations** across weight, BP, pulse, temperature, and respiratory measurements\n",
    "2. We analyze weight loss patterns that show **3.6× CRC risk elevation** for rapid weight loss and engineer 70+ features including trajectory analysis and clinical flags\n",
    "3. We reduce to **24 optimized features** (66% reduction) while preserving all critical signals, particularly weight loss indicators that represent the strongest CRC predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key finding:** Rapid weight loss (>5% in 60 days) shows **3.6× risk ratio** (1.24% CRC rate vs 0.36% baseline) - the strongest single predictor identified\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coverage:** 95% have weight/BMI/BP measurements | **Weight trends:** 28% have 6-month comparisons | **Time to run:** ~15 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** 24-feature dataset with comprehensive vital signs ready for model integration"

    "## 📋 Introduction: Vital Signs Feature Engineering for CRC Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Vital signs capture physiological changes that often precede colorectal cancer diagnosis by months. This notebook extracts and engineers features from **858K patient-month observations** to identify early CRC indicators through:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight Loss as Cardinal Sign**\n",
    "- Unintentional weight loss present in up to 40% of CRC patients at diagnosis\n",
    "- Results from tumor metabolism, reduced intake, or malabsorption\n",
    "- Often begins months before other symptoms appear\n",
    "- Expected signal strength: 4-5× risk elevation for significant weight loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cancer Cachexia Syndrome**\n",
    "- Affects 50-80% of advanced cancer patients\n",
    "- Characterized by muscle mass loss that cannot be reversed by nutrition\n",
    "- Combination of weight loss + low BMI indicates advanced disease\n",
    "- Early detection may identify at-risk patients\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blood Pressure Patterns**\n",
    "- BP variability may indicate systemic stress or autonomic dysfunction\n",
    "- Wide pulse pressure associated with cardiovascular comorbidities\n",
    "- Hypertension both risk factor and potential consequence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Measurements:** Weight/BMI (primary focus), blood pressure, heart rate, temperature\n",
    "**Temporal Patterns:** 6-month and 12-month trends, rapid loss detection in 60-day windows\n",
    "**Advanced Features:** Weight trajectory analysis, BP variability, cachexia risk scoring\n",
    "**Clinical Thresholds:** Evidence-based flags for hypertension, obesity, tachycardia, fever\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Coverage:** ~95% weight/BMI/BP coverage, ~28% weight trends\n",
    "- **Risk Signals:** 3-4× elevation for weight loss, 2× for cachexia indicators\n",
    "- **Population:** Median BMI ~28, median BP ~126/75 mmHg\n",
    "- **Final Output:** ~24 optimized features preserving all critical CRC signals\n",
    "\n",
    "The vitals features, particularly weight trajectories, are expected to be among the strongest predictors in the final model, providing non-invasive, routinely collected signals for CRC risk assessment."

    "Implements sophisticated temporal extraction using ROW_NUMBER() to find the most recent vital signs before each snapshot date. Separately extracts historical values at 6 and 12 months prior (±30 day tolerance) for trend calculations, creating a comprehensive temporal vital signs profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters for Vitals\n",
    "Recency matters critically for vital signs—a weight from 6 months ago may not reflect current health status. The ±30 day tolerance windows ensure we capture meaningful historical comparisons while accounting for irregular visit schedules.\n",

    "## 🔧 Introduction: Vitals Feature Reduction Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Feature Reduction is Essential\n",
    "\n",
    "The vitals feature engineering produced approximately **70 features** including raw measurements, recency indicators, change metrics, pattern features, and clinical flags. While comprehensive, this creates several modeling challenges that require systematic reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multicollinearity Issues:**\n",
    "- **Unit duplicates**: `WEIGHT_OZ` vs `WEIGHT_LB` contain identical information\n",
    "- **Temporal redundancy**: `DAYS_SINCE_SBP` vs `DAYS_SINCE_DBP` measured simultaneously  \n",
    "- **Change metric overlap**: Multiple weight loss percentages (5%, 10%, 6mo, 12mo) highly correlated\n",
    "- **BP measurement correlation**: Systolic, diastolic, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure interdependent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Efficiency:**\n",
    "- **Model training speed**: 70 features significantly slow gradient-based algorithms\n",
    "- **Memory requirements**: Large feature matrices strain computational resources\n",
    "- **Overfitting risk**: High-dimensional feature space relative to positive cases (3,100 CRC events)\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Too many features obscure clinical decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clinical Practicality:**\n",
    "- **Implementation complexity**: Fewer features simplify real-world deployment\n",
    "- **Feature importance clarity**: Reduced set highlights most critical predictors\n",
    "- **Maintenance burden**: Fewer features require less ongoing validation and monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reduction Methodology &amp; Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Our feature reduction strategy balances statistical rigor with clinical domain knowledge through a systematic multi-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Remove Obvious Redundancies**\n",
    "- Eliminate unit duplicates (`WEIGHT_LB` when `WEIGHT_OZ` available)\n",
    "- Remove raw date columns (less informative than `days_since` features)\n",
    "- Drop simultaneous measurements (`DAYS_SINCE_DBP` = `DAYS_SINCE_SBP`)\n",
    "- Filter very low prevalence flags (<0.5% occurrence rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Calculate Dual Statistical Metrics**\n",
    "- **Risk ratios for binary features**: Clinical interpretability (e.g., \"3.6× higher risk\")\n",
    "- **Mutual information for all features**: Captures non-linear relationships and continuous patterns\n",
    "- **Impact scoring**: Balances prevalence with effect size for prioritization\n",
    "- **Stratified sampling**: Efficient MI calculation preserving all positive cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Apply Clinical Domain Knowledge**\n",
    "- **Must-keep features**: All weight loss indicators (strongest CRC predictors)\n",
    "- **Clinical significance**: Preserve cachexia scoring, core vital measurements\n",
    "- **Evidence-based thresholds**: Maintain hypertension, obesity, underweight flags\n",
    "- **Temporal patterns**: Retain trajectory analysis for trend detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Handle Feature Groups**\n",
    "- **Weight loss cluster**: Keep multiple representations due to critical importance\n",
    "- **BP measurements**: Select optimal subset avoiding multicollinearity\n",
    "- **Recency features**: Prioritize most clinically relevant timing indicators\n",
    "- **Variability metrics**: Choose single best representative per measurement type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Create Composite Features**\n",
    "- **Weight loss severity scale**: Ordinal 0-3 combining multiple thresholds\n",
    "- **Cardiovascular risk score**: Hypertension + obesity interaction\n",
    "- **Vital recency indicator**: Measurement freshness for reliability assessment\n",
    "- **Abnormal pattern flags**: Complex clinical patterns in single features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcomes &amp; Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative Goals:**\n",
    "- **Target feature count**: ~25 features (65% reduction from ~70)\n",
    "- **Signal preservation**: Maintain all features with >2× risk elevation\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity resolution**: Correlation matrix with max |r| < 0.8\n",
    "- **Coverage maintenance**: Preserve features covering >80% of observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clinical Validation Criteria:**\n",
    "- **Weight loss signals**: All rapid/severe weight loss indicators preserved\n",
    "- **Core measurements**: BMI, systolic BP, weight maintained\n",
    "- **Risk stratification**: Cachexia scoring and clinical flags retained\n",
    "- **Temporal patterns**: Weight trajectory and BP variability included\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Performance Expectations:**\n",
    "- **Predictive power**: Minimal AUC degradation (<2% loss)\n",
    "- **Feature importance**: Clear hierarchy with weight loss features dominant\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Each feature clinically meaningful and actionable\n",
    "- **Computational efficiency**: 3× faster training with reduced feature set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights from Vitals Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our comprehensive vitals analysis, the reduction process must preserve these critical findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exceptional Weight Loss Signals:**\n",
    "- **Rapid weight loss (60-day)**: 3.6× risk elevation - highest priority preservation\n",
    "- **Severe weight loss (10%)**: 3.0× risk elevation - must retain\n",
    "- **Moderate weight loss (5%)**: 3.2× risk elevation - clinical standard threshold\n",
    "- **Weight trajectory patterns**: Slope and consistency metrics for trend analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary Predictive Patterns:**\n",
    "- **Cachexia risk scoring**: 2.1× risk elevation combining BMI + weight loss\n",
    "- **BP variability**: High variability (>15 mmHg) indicating cardiovascular stress\n",
    "- **Obesity interaction**: 1.3× risk elevation, important for risk stratification\n",
    "- **Measurement recency**: Stale vitals may indicate care gaps or patient status\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Interaction Considerations:**\n",
    "- **Weight × BMI**: Cachexia requires both low BMI and weight loss\n",
    "- **BP × age**: Hypertension significance varies by patient age\n",
    "- **Recency × change**: Recent measurements more reliable for trend calculation\n",
    "- **Volatility × trajectory**: Consistent trends vs erratic patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dual-Metric Statistical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk Ratios (Binary Features):**\n",
    "- **Calculation**: CRC rate with feature present ÷ CRC rate with feature absent\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Direct clinical meaning (\"3× higher risk\")\n",
    "- **Best for**: Threshold-based features (flags, categorical indicators)\n",
    "- **Sample size**: Full 858K observations for maximum precision\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutual Information (All Features):**\n",
    "- **Calculation**: Information content about CRC outcome\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Captures complex non-linear relationships\n",
    "- **Best for**: Continuous features with subtle patterns\n",
    "- **Sample size**: Stratified 100K sample (all positives + sampled negatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Both Metrics:**\n",
    "Different feature types require different evaluation approaches. Risk ratios excel for binary clinical flags where threshold effects dominate, while mutual information captures continuous patterns that simple ratios miss. The combination ensures no signal type is overlooked during reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Integration Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The reduced vitals feature set will integrate with other feature categories to form a comprehensive CRC detection model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vitals Component (~25 features):**\n",
    "- Weight loss patterns and trajectory analysis\n",
    "- Core vital measurements and clinical flags  \n",
    "- BP variability and cardiovascular risk indicators\n",
    "- Composite scores and temporal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integration with Other Features:**\n",
    "- **Laboratory features**: Iron studies, CBC, metabolic panels\n",
    "- **Diagnostic codes**: Bleeding symptoms, GI complaints, screening history\n",
    "- **Demographics**: Age, gender, comorbidity burden\n",
    "- **Healthcare utilization**: Visit patterns, specialist referrals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Synergies:**\n",
    "- **Weight loss + anemia**: Classic CRC presentation pattern\n",
    "- **BP variability + age**: Cardiovascular risk stratification\n",
    "- **Cachexia + bleeding**: Advanced disease indicators\n",
    "- **Measurement frequency + utilization**: Care engagement patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature reduction process ensures the vitals component contributes maximum predictive value while maintaining clinical interpretability and computational efficiency for the integrated CRC detection model.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 📊 Feature Selection Metrics: What Do They Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use three complementary metrics to evaluate each feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Risk Ratio** (for binary features)\n",
    "- **What it measures:** How much more likely is CRC if this feature is present?\n",
    "- **Example:** Bleeding has a 6.3× risk ratio → patients with bleeding are 6.3 times more likely to develop CRC than those without\n",
    "- **Formula:** `(CRC rate with feature) / (CRC rate without feature)`\n",
    "- **Good values:** >2× indicates a strong predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Mutual Information (MI)**\n",
    "- **What it measures:** How much does knowing this feature reduce uncertainty about CRC?\n",
    "- **Why it's useful:** Captures non-linear relationships that correlation misses\n",
    "- **Example:** Bowel pattern (categorical: constipation/diarrhea/alternating) has highest MI (0.047) because the *pattern* matters, not just presence/absence\n",
    "- **Good values:** >0.01 indicates meaningful information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Impact Score**\n",
    "- **What it measures:** Balances prevalence with risk magnitude\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** A rare symptom with huge risk (bleeding: 1.3% prevalence, 6.3× risk) can have high impact. A common symptom with modest risk (anemia: 6.9% prevalence, 3.3× risk) can also have high impact.\n",
    "- **Formula:** `prevalence × log2(risk_ratio)`\n",
    "- **Good values:** >0.05 indicates high impact\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** We need all three metrics because:\n",
    "- Risk ratio alone ignores how common the feature is\n",
    "- MI alone doesn't tell us the direction of the relationship\n",
    "- Impact score alone doesn't capture non-linear patterns"
